Recurrent Neural Networks\n","In a recurrent neural network we store the output activations from one or more of the layers of the network. Often these are hidden later activations. Then, the next time we feed an input example to the network, we include the previously-stored outputs as additional inputs. You can think of the additional inputs as being concatenated to the end of the “normal” inputs to the previous layer. For example, if a hidden layer had 10 regular input nodes and 128 hidden nodes in the layer, then it would actually have 138 total inputs (assuming you are feeding the layer’s outputs into itself à la Elman) rather than into another layer). Of course, the very first time you try to compute the output of the network you’ll need to fill in those extra 128 inputs with 0s or something.\n","\n","Source: [Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-simple-explanation-of-a-recurrent-neural-network)\n","\n","<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n","<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*NKhwsOYNUT5xU7Pyf6Znhg.png\"  width=\"50%\" height=\"50%\">\n","</div>\n","\n","Source: [Medium](https://medium.com/ai-journal/lstm-gru-recurrent-neural-networks-81fe2bcdf1f9)\n","\n","Let me give you the best explanation of Recurrent Neural Networks that I found on internet: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNmqTiOnRfg&t=3s"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","collapsed":true,"trusted":false},"source":["Now, even though RNNs are quite powerful, they suffer from  **Vanishing gradient problem ** which hinders them from using long term information, like they are good for storing memory 3-4 instances of past iterations but larger number of instances don't provide good results so we don't just use regular RNNs. Instead, we use a better variation of RNNs: **Long Short Term Networks(LSTM).**\n","\n","### What is Vanishing Gradient problem?\n","Vanishing gradient problem is a difficulty found in training artificial neural networks with gradient-based learning methods and backpropagation. In such methods, each of the neural network's weights receives an update proportional to the partial derivative of the error function with respect to the current weight in each iteration of training. The problem is that in some cases, the gradient will be vanishingly small, effectively preventing the weight from changing its value. In the worst case, this may completely stop the neural network from further training. As one example of the problem cause, traditional activation functions such as the hyperbolic tangent function have gradients in the range (0, 1), and backpropagation computes gradients by the chain rule. This has the effect of multiplying n of these small numbers to compute gradients of the \"front\" layers in an n-layer network, meaning that the gradient (error signal) decreases exponentially with n while the front layers train very slowly.\n","\n","Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanishing_gradient_problem)\n","\n","<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n","<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1460/1*FWy4STsp8k0M5Yd8LifG_Q.png\"  width=\"50%\" height=\"50%\">\n","</div>\n","\n","Source: [Medium](https://medium.com/@anishsingh20/the-vanishing-gradient-problem-48ae7f501257)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_uuid":"79ac683d1b85322f6ed4a564637914a8d803221b"},"source":["## II.

They're great at capturing patterns and dependencies in these sequences.\n","\n","- *Memory Cells*: At the core of an LSTM are memory cells. These cells have the ability to store information for long periods and decide when to forget or remember information. This capability helps LSTMs avoid the vanishing gradient problem, a common issue with traditional RNNs.\n","\n","- *Gates*: LSTMs use three types of gates to control the flow of information into and out of the memory cells:\n","   - **Forget Gate**: Decides what information from the previous cell state should be thrown away or kept.\n","   - **Input Gate**: Determines what new information should be added to the cell state.\n","   - **Output Gate**: Computes the final output based on the current cell state, taking into account the input and the forget gate.\n","\n","- *Hidden State*: LSTMs also have a hidden state, which is similar to the cell state but is used to carry information from one time step to the next.\n","\n","- *Training*: During training, LSTMs learn the parameters of their gates and cell states through backpropagation, adjusting their weights to make accurate predictions based on the input sequence.\n","\n","In essence, an LSTM is like a smart unit that can selectively remember or forget information as it processes a sequence.
